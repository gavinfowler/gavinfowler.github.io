<p>For the final project in my Mobile Development class, we were asked to create an app that would be able to track your exercise, specifically your runs.</p>

<p>While coding this app I learned about many different packages and android APIs. Some of the packages I used were</p>

<ul>
<li>NativeBase</li>
<li>React-Native Camera</li>
<li>React-Native Maps</li>
<li>React Navigation</li>
</ul>

<p>Through this was one of the hardest assignments in that class, I learned quite a bit. Figuring out how to make sure to use the packages together properly was one of the most frustrating parts. Just attempting to run anything once I had installed the packages was difficult. The solution to my problem was to shift my react-native version back.</p>

<p>All the frustrating parts aside, I did have a lot of fun putting this app together. Being able to create a line of dots on a map from GPS information was a satisfying moment. Once I got everything wired up and working like I wanted it was an incredible feeling. Being able to take such an abstract idea and turn it into reality is such a great feeling. That feeling is one of the main reasons I decided to become a programmer.</p>

<p>Although I would have liked to add persistent data, it was not one of the requirements and unfortunately I had many other finals to worry about ðŸ˜‰. Persistent data was one of the few things from that class that I felt like I never understood all that well. But I am currently building an app right now that requires persistent data so I&rsquo;ll have to figure it out soon.</p>
