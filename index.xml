      <description>Schooling I am currently a senior studying computer science at Utah State University.
[projects]
I have played many instruments but I most enjoyed playing saxophone and Euphonium.
I played in a jazz band all through middle school and high school. I am a fan of jaz music with some of my favorite artists being: the Brecker Brothers, Tower of Power, and Charlie Parker.
I participated in marching band for 3 years in highschool and this led to a year in the Battalion Drum and Bugle Corps (pronounced `core` ;) ).</description>
