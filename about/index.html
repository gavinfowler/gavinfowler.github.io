			<p>I am a senior studying computer science at Utah State University. Some of my favorite classes have been Mobile Application Development, Operating Systems and concurrency, and Introduction to Landscape Architecture.
During this last school year I worked on the following projects:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/projects/restaurantpicker/">RestaurantPicker</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gavinfowler/CS3200FinalProject">A workout app</a></li>
</ul>

<!-- [Projects](/projects/) -->

<p>I currently work at the Space Dynamics Lab in Logan, UT as an engineering assistant. I am working on a Java web application with ExtJS on the front end. I have also assisted in helping our lead developer in using python and bash scripting.</p>

<p>I participated in concert, jazz and marching band for 3 years in high school, playing saxophone, baritone, and trombone. This led to a year in the Battalion Drum and Bugle Corps playing euphonium. I have played many different instruments but my favorites have included baritone saxophone in jazz band and trombone in concert band.
I am a fan of jazz music with some of my favorite artists/groups being: the Brecker Brothers, Tower of Power (especially Doc Kupka, who plays bari sax), and Charlie Parker.</p>
