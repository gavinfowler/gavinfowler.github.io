## **Schooling**

I am currently a senior studying computer science at Utah State University.

\[projects\]

I have played many instruments but I most enjoyed playing saxophone and Euphonium.

I played in a jazz band all through middle school and high school. I am a fan of jaz music with some of my favorite artists being: the Brecker Brothers, Tower of Power, and Charlie Parker.

I participated in marching band for 3 years in highschool and this led to a year in the Battalion Drum and Bugle Corps (pronounced \`core\` ;) ).
